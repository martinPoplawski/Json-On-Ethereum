# Json-On-Ethereum

### Prerequisites
* A Blockchain, can be mainnet or local with for example [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
* A Browser that has the [Metamask Extension](https://metamask.io)
* For local tests, a simple Server is needed for optimal usage. Can be done with a simple python command:  
  *$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer*

### How to use
  1. Deploy the Smart Contract on Blockchain
  2. Run *configure.sh* with:  
     *$ ./configure.sh*  
     And change the Smart Contract address and the Ethereum address from which you want to use the application
  3. If tested locally, start the server. 
  4. Open the *index.html* file in the server.
